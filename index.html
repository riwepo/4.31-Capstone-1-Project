      Trommel screen welding project.<br />
      A <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trommel_screen">trommel</a> is
      like a giant cylindrical sieve with a spiral inside. IR4 developed a
      <a href="https://www.tei.com.au/products/steel-trommels"
        >purpose built turnkey welding system</a
      >
      for welding the spiral and other parts into steel trommels. The trommel
      was mounted on its side on rollers, and could be rotated, and a column and
      boom moved a robot welder relative to the trommel, first laser scanning to
      confirm the geometry, then applying welds between the part and the
      trommel. The system was tested on about 6 different models of trommel. It
      was designed to work with future models as long as they were within
      certain parameters.

    <h4>Project contributions:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Contribute to the overall system concept and design and workflow</li>
      <li>
        Architect and develop a desktop application that analyses a geometry
        file of a trommel and creates all of the instructions for the robots to
        fabricate the trommel
      </li>
      <li>This application could perform the following tasks</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Import geometry files exported from CAD packages, find the individual
          physical parts in the file, convert them to triangular meshes and save
          the information in a database
        </li>
        <li>
          Categorise the various imported parts according to the types of parts
          expected
        </li>
        <li>
          Spatially transform all parts into a standard orientation expected by
          the system
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine sets of parts and find the collision intersection loops
          between them where welds would be need to be applied
        </li>
        <li>
          Using different solid models of the system scanner and welder robot
          end effectors, find reachable poses for the robot arm, within various
          constraints, allowing the robot to reach in and scan and weld the
          parts
        </li>
        <li>
          Display the trommel parts in a User Interface (UI) allowing the user
          to enable/disable selected parts or selected welds between parts
        </li>
        <li>Generate the required build instructions for the robots</li>
        <li>
          Display an animated 3D representation of the build produced by
          stepping through the robot instructions
        </li>
        <li>Transmit the generated build to the robot system</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Project outcomes:</h4>
    <p>
      The system was delivered successfuly and cut the manuafacturing time for a
      trommel from weeks to less than a day. The knowledge from the project is
      expected to help greatly with future IR4 projects.

      'SSS' stands for Smart Steel Systems. SSS Manufacturing developed a system
      that could import building geometry from a file exported from a CAD
      system, and automatically generate the robot instructions required to
      fabricate the beams and columns in the building. SSS Manufacturing had a
      large dedicated factory to house both a development team and a steel
      manufacturing facility. The manufacturing facility consisted of a series
      of custom made vice robots on tracks that could manipulate steel beams and
      convey them though a manufacturing cell where several other robots would
      make cuts with a plasma cutter, place plates in position and weld those
      plates to the beam. The system also included a flat plate cutting
      component where the required flat plates such as braces and cleats that
      were to be welded to the beam could be cut from flat sheets with a robot
      plasma cutter.

      My primary role at ASE was in developing a data acquisition and reporting
      system for coal washing plants. One part of the system was a custom data
      acquisition module which was located remote on site and was interfaced to
      local Citect SCADA system controlling the washplant. This data acquisition
      module would reliably replicate the data collected back to SQL servers in
      Brisbane. Another part of the system was a reporting engine which
      generated SSRS reports on this data using sophisticated SQL queries. The
      final part of the system was a web based application to select a report to
      view, enter parameters and view the generated reports.
